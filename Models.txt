Model:
- A representation of the real world. 
-- Requires some data about the real world.
- Analytical model: Equation or function that represents (best fits) the data.
-- Linear, polynomial, exponential, sinusoidal, logarithmic, hyperbolic, radical
-- Plug in an input and the equation gives the output
--- h(t) = 2 t + 7
---- input: t
---- output: h
-- Only works for well behaved systems (simple systems). Not a whole lot of interactions that will introduce errors. Non-chaotic.
-- Often use calculus to find the equations. 
- Physical models -
-- Small scale physical thing (you can touch it)
-- Can be more complex
-- Problems with scaling.
- Numerical models
-- Usually computer models because there's a lot of calculations (algebraic)
-- Usually break the system into smaller parts that interact with each other.
-- The computer is used to keep track of all the interactions.
-- We'll focus on things that change over time. 
-- We'll focus on finite difference models.
